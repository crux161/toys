    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">The following is a list of 10 programs everyone should understand the concepts of and how to implement them in actual code (hopefully across several languages, but initially with a focus on rust).</p>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="content_title">  Hello World:</div>
        <h3>A simple program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. This program is often used as an introduction to programming and is a good starting point for learning a new programming language.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Calculator:</div>
        <h3>A program that performs simple arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program can be extended to perform more complex calculations such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  FizzBuzz:</div>
        <h3>A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz". This program tests a programmer's ability to use conditional statements and loops.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Factorial:</div>
        <h3>A program that computes the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. This program tests a programmer's ability to use recursion.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Binary Search:</div>
        <h3>A program that implements the binary search algorithm to find the position of a given value in a sorted list of values. This program tests a programmer's ability to use arrays and implement algorithms.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Sorting:</div>
        <h3>A program that implements a sorting algorithm such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, or merge sort. This program tests a programmer's ability to implement algorithms and use arrays.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  File Input/Output:</div>
        <h3>A program that reads data from a file and writes data to a file. This program tests a programmer's ability to work with files and use file input/output functions.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Tic Tac Toe:</div>
        <h3>A program that implements the game of Tic Tac Toe. This program tests a programmer's ability to use conditional statements, loops, and implement game logic.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Palindrome:</div>
        <h3>A program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. This program tests a programmer's ability to use loops and string manipulation functions.</h3>
        <div class="content_title">  Random Number Generator:</div>
        <h3>A program that generates random numbers within a given range. This program tests a programmer's ability to use random number functions and implement basic algorithms.</h3>
